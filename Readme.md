#Smart Mirror

I had another project called FRIDAY-JAVA, this is basically that but re-written in python and with a GUI


some advice from a forum:
"When you want to distribute or simply open source your python codes, the good choice is to use pip freeze > requirements.txt to get a dependency file. You can add requirements.txt into git version control."
