#Smart Mirror

I had another project called FRIDAY-JAVA, this is basically that but re-written in python and with a GUI


sudo pip3 install selenium selenium-requests numpy eel forex-python simpleaudio kamene netaddr geocoder pyaudio SpeechRecognition

pyaudio may require you to install portaudio dev 
1. sudo apt-get update 
2. sudo apt-get upgrade 
3. sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev 
4. sudo apt-get install tcpdump
5. sudo apt-get install flac
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev


ChromeDriver is required. For rpi use arm builds 
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/trusty/+package/chromium-chromedriver 


chromedriver/chrome compatibilities (both required)
http://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/web/chromedriver/
(Im considering using firefox driver to avoid install both tho??)

I CANNOT FIND AN ARM BUILD OF CHROMEDRIVER AND CHROMIUM THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH EACHOTHER OMGGGGG
